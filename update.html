            <h1>Covid-19</h1>
            <h1>November 29, 2020</h1>
            <section>
              <p>As of today Nov 27 (4pm), there are 187,867 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Houston/Harris County and 2,418 deaths. A total of 164,743 patients have recovered. The positivity rate is 9.6%.</p>
             <h1>November 13, 2020</h1> 
              <p>Nationally, surveillance indicators tracking levels of SARS-CoV-2 virus circulation and associated illnesses have been increasing since September. The percentage of deaths due to pneumonia, influenza and COVID-19 (PIC) increased throughout the month of October. Both COVID-19 related hospitalizations and PIC mortality for the most recent weeks are expected to increase as more data are received.</p>
             <h1>October 31, 2020</h1> 
              <p>Nationally, the overall percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, increased from 10.8% during week 45 to 11.9% during week 46. Percent positivity increased among all age groups. Regionally, the percentages of respiratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 increased in nine of the ten HHS regions.</p>
             <h1>October 26, 2020</h1> 
              <p>Since the week ending September 19 (MMWR week 38), weekly hospitalization rates among all age groups combined are increasing. Based on death certificate data, the percentage of deaths attributed to PIC for week 46 was 10.7% and, while declining compared with week 45 (14.4%), remains above the epidemic threshold. The weekly percentages of deaths due to PIC increased throughout October and are expected to increase for the most recent weeks as additional data are reported. Hospitalization rates for the most recent week are also expected to increase as additional data are reported.</p>
              <h1>October 25, 2020</h1>
              <p>Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:
                Fever or chills
                Cough
                Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
                Fatigue
                Muscle or body aches
                Headache
                New loss of taste or smell
                Sore throat
                Congestion or runny nose
                Nausea or vomiting
                Diarrhea
                Look for emergency warning signs for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately:
                Trouble breathing
                Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
                New confusion
                Inability to wake or stay awake
                Bluish lips or face</p>
